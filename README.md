# todoApp
simple to do app for practice purposes:

You can add tasks with the text input field.<br>
The input has focus, so start typing and hit enter to add your tasks.<br>
By hitting enter or pressing the "new" button, your tasks will be stored locally in the browser,
so they will be there after closing the browser.<br>
By clicking on a task, it is marked as done and is removed from the local storage. (it gets 50% opacity and a checked icon behind)<br>
To remove the done marked task, press the "remove done tasks" button.<br>

<br><br>

I added a timer [easytimer.js](https://github.com/albert-gonzalez/easytimer.js) to retrace how much time I spend on my projects:

You can add projects with the MyTimer's text input field.<br>
Run the timer by pressing the "start" button.<br>
To store the elapsed time you have to press the "stop" button. There is no autosave so far! <br>
You can store four projects at the same time.<br>
To remove a project, press the "remove project" button (the project container gets a red background) and select the project you want to remove.
